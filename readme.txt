== Description ==

>NEW WooCommerce Settings Arrived for Premium version!

This plugin is showing a Popup for visitors to verify their ages on your page. YES button will close the Popup and visitors can continue reading your content. NO button will redirect visitors to another URL, set by you to inform them about your policy.

The CPS | Age Verification plugin can be used on 18+ adult sites, restricted content websites or any websites, where a visitor confirmation about age, knowledge, warning is necessary to continue reading the website. Even can be used for online marketing tricks.

This plugin can be an alternative for other Cookie Notice plugins to inform users that your site uses cookies and to comply with the EU cookie law regulations.

### Cache Proof Technology

The CPS | Age Verification plugin is compatible with all kind of cache systems. It even works with all managed WordPress hostings' server side cache solutions.

### Features in details

#### Popup Positions
You can set where to show the popup, for example: only on frontpage, only on category pages, only on special pages or posts, even for Custom Post Types and more...

#### Customizations
Every text is customizable, even the button's texts! You can also set the design of the buttons and you have the option to make the first or the second button to be the confirmation button.

#### Developer Friendly
If you enable debug mode, popup will show always, on every refresh, so you can test how it works.

#### WPML & Polylang Compatible
If you have a multilingual website, you can set the texts for each language with WPML String Translation add-on.

#### Header Image Field / Logo
You can upload an image or logo, that will display above the title. It can be an icon also. Make your popup to fit your website and brand.

#### Set Background Image
Custom background image for the popup. It will cover the entire screen with your beautiful background. One of the best design feature to wow your visitors.

#### Popup Styles
There are popup styles to choose the look and feel of the popup: Default, Almost Flat and Gradient. Fit the style to your website easily.

#### Popup Themes
There are popup themes to choose the design, you like. The Full Page Themes are hiding the entire content behind the popup. There are a lot of design settings to make the popup fit your website design. Dark mode is also available.

#### Button Styles
Choose from one of the pre-defined button styles to fit your message and design. You can set custom style for your "yes" and for your "no" button individually.

#### Dark mode
Welcome to the dark side! If you prefer dark design, this feature is for you. Choose this option also, when you have a dark background image.

#### Membership Mode
You can disable popup for logged in users, so your members will not see any popups at all. You can always show the popup to all visitors, who are not logged in, even if they clicked on the Yes button. There is a "One button mode" also, that will hide the second button, so you can show only one option to your visitors. This option is best paired with the "always show to all visitors, who are not logged in" option, so you can keep your content safe.

#### Close Popup
Yes, I know, the point of an age verification popup is, that it can not be closed without the consent. But some of you missed this feature, so it is built in. Don't use, if you don't need it!

#### Popup Delay
Set your preferred time to delay the popup after the page is loaded. Maybe you want your visitors to have a few seconds to see the webpage and only then ask them to consent your conditions.

#### Cookie Control
Set cookie expiration for visitors, so the popup won't show again in X days, you set.

#### WooCommerce Settings
Set the popup to show it on WooCommerce pages, like Shop, Cart, Checkout, Account pages or Product category and tag archive pages.
